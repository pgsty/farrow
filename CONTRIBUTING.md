# Contributing to Farrow

## Before you start

Farrow is pre-1.0 and deliberately small. The design has a few ratified
non-negotiables, and a change that contradicts one of them will be declined no
matter how well it is implemented:

- **Exactly one deployment per user.** No projects, no leases, no workspaces.
- **One inventory format.** A Pigsty-compatible Ansible inventory is the only
  configuration. `farrow.yml` is preferred over `pigsty.yml` only as a filename.
- **The `vm_*` namespace is strict; everything else is opaque.** An unknown
  `vm_*` key is a hard error. A non-`vm_*` key is never validated.
- **Absence never destroys.** Removing a host from the inventory does not delete
  a machine. Destruction is always explicit and confirmed.
- **One helper binary.** Privileged work goes through `farrow-hosts-helper` or
  the reviewed network plan, and nowhere else.

Open an issue before a large change so we can agree on the shape first.

## Development loop

```bash
make build     # build ./bin/farrow and ./bin/farrow-hosts-helper
make test      # unit tests
make race      # race detector
make check     # everything CI runs, before you push
```

`make check` runs module verification, shell syntax checks, unit and race tests,
`go vet`, Staticcheck, four-target dead-code intersection, errcheck,
`govulncheck`, cross-compilation for all four supported targets, the
image-pipeline boundary tests, and the dependency-license inventory. It must
pass before a pull request is ready.

The toolchain is pinned in `packaging/toolchain.env` and CI asserts the exact
versions, so install those versions locally:

```bash
go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@v0.8.1
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/deadcode@v0.49.0
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.13.1
go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@v1.7.0
```

Changes under `tools/`, `packaging/`, `.goreleaser.yaml`, or the `Makefile` also
run the `packaging` workflow, which builds and verifies a complete snapshot
release. Run it locally with `make release-snapshot` if you have GoReleaser,
nFPM, and Syft at the pinned versions.

## Maintenance and release tools

Catalog maintenance stays separate from the user-facing `farrow repo` command.
`tools/catalogexport` writes the exact catalog embedded in the current source;
the destination must be an absolute path that does not exist. `tools/catalogsign`
manages Minisign keys and signatures accepted by the runtime. Its password is
read only from inherited `CATALOGSIGN_PASSWORD` (empty is allowed), never from a
command-line argument. Production private keys never enter this repository or
CI; they stay on the repository host.

```bash
make catalog-export CATALOG_OUTPUT=/absolute/new/catalog.json
make catalog-keygen CATALOG_KEY_DIR=/absolute/private CATALOG_KEY_NAME=farrow-catalog-next
make catalog-sign CATALOG_KEY=/absolute/private/farrow-catalog-next.key CATALOG_FILE=/absolute/catalog.json
make catalog-verify CATALOG_PUBLIC_KEY=/absolute/private/farrow-catalog-next.pub CATALOG_FILE=/absolute/catalog.json
```

Catalog Minisign signatures are consumed by Farrow and remain independent of
application delivery. Application archives and packages are built by GitHub
Actions and listed in `checksums.txt`; no separate application-release signing
or provenance bundle is produced.

`make release-dev VERSION=0.2.1-dev.1 SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(git show -s --format=%ct HEAD)`
builds and verifies the older unsigned development-archive path. The packaging
workflow runs it alongside the GoReleaser snapshot; neither path publishes
anything.

`packaging/image-pipeline/build-official.py --list` shows the fixed eight-image
candidate matrix. A build requires explicit source, package-cache, and output
directories; it refuses to replace an existing bundle. After all architecture
builds are copied to one host, repeat `--assemble-from` for each bundle root to
create a new unsigned candidate repository and run `farrow repo build/verify`.
The command never edits `packaging/image-repository/repo.yaml`, signs a catalog,
or publishes files; those remain separate owner-controlled promotion gates.

The maintenance inventory below names files whose owner is otherwise indirect.
`make maintenance-check` fails when a new file under `tools/` or `packaging/`
has no Make, workflow, or inventory reference.

- GoReleaser hooks: `packaging/goreleaser-package-sbom.sh`,
  `packaging/goreleaser-package-stage.sh`, and `packaging/goreleaser-sbom.sh`.
- Archive/package composition: `packaging/binary-format.sh`,
  `packaging/payload-inventory.sh`, `packaging/render-homebrew.sh`,
  `packaging/homebrew/farrow.rb.tmpl`, `packaging/install.sh`, and
  `packaging/nfpm.yaml`.
- Image construction: `packaging/image-pipeline/build.sh`,
  `packaging/image-pipeline/build-official.py`,
  `packaging/image-pipeline/normalize-guest.sh`,
  `packaging/image-pipeline/official-v1.json`,
  `packaging/image-pipeline/pipeline.py`,
  `packaging/image-pipeline/recipe-v1.json`, and
  `packaging/image-pipeline/.gitignore`.
- Repository fixture: `packaging/image-repository/repo.yaml`.

## House style

The code aims to read as one voice. Match what is already there.

- **Comments explain why, never what.** If a comment restates the code, delete
  it. If a line looks arbitrary, the comment says what would break otherwise.
- **Names are words, not abbreviations.** `resolved`, `candidate`, `imageRecord`
  — not `res`, `c`, `img`.
- **Errors are lowercase, specific, and actionable.** Say what was wrong and
  what to do: `hosts target changed after review; refusing stale plan`.
- **No map iteration reaching output.** Sort keys. Identical input must produce
  identical output and identical errors.
- **Fail closed.** When identity, ownership, or a digest cannot be proven,
  refuse rather than proceed.
- **No compatibility shims for formats that were never released.** Farrow reads
  exactly one catalog schema and one inventory format.

## Tests

- A bug fix comes with a test that fails before it and passes after.
- Tests must not depend on the machine they run on: no hardcoded UIDs, home
  directories, network access, or the presence of a specific QEMU build. Skip
  cleanly when an external tool is genuinely required.
- Prefer testing the contract over the implementation. Assert the behaviour a
  user or a script would observe.

## Compatibility expiry

Farrow tolerates old local state only when a released build or a pre-0.1
development build wrote it. It never guesses at formats that Farrow never
wrote. Every exception has an expiry gate; reaching the version alone is not
enough unless the migration or refusal condition is also satisfied.

| ID | Path and old form | Last writer | Must remain supported through | Removal gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `process-start-v0` | `internal/process/identity.go`, `internal/private/manager.go`: locale-dependent `ps lstart` birth text and its legacy argv binding | pre-0.1 development builds | 0.2.x | Earliest 0.3.0, after 0.2 release notes require `farrow status` while each retained VM is live and migration tests prove the persisted identity was rewritten to `procstat:`/`kinfo:` plus the native argv hash. |
| `user-network-state-v0` | `cmd/farrow/main.go`: a deployment whose resolved network is `user` gets the fixed-IP redesign refusal instead of being interpreted as current state | pre-0.1 development builds | 0.2.x | Earliest 0.3.0, after the 0.2 migration window and release notes have told users to preserve disks and rebuild; never add a parser for another user-NAT shape. |
| `manifest-state-v1` | `internal/image/manifest_store.go`: the single-repository manifest state is wrapped as the `default` entry in the registry | pre-0.1 development builds | 0.2.x | Earliest 0.3.0, after a 0.2 release rewrites the registry in place on successful sync/reset and the real legacy fixture proves that migration. |
| `linux-network-backend-v0` | `internal/network/linux/plan.go`: a root-owned network manifest without `backend` means `systemd-networkd` | pre-0.1 development builds | 0.2.x | Earliest 0.3.0, after 0.2 has rewritten or explicitly uninstalled every accepted backend-less manifest and the uninstall fixture no longer needs the default. |
| `guest-hosts-marker-v0` | `internal/cloudinit/render.go`: marker-owned guest `/etc/hosts` rows use `# farrow-project-host` | 0.1.0 | 0.3.x | 0.2.x and 0.3.x write `# farrow-deployment-host` and remove both markers; remove the old marker no earlier than 0.4.0 after two minor release lines have converged guests. |
| `inherited-files-v0` | `internal/private/shares.go`: an empty typed inherited-file list may still describe the Darwin network FD in argv; shares never use that representation | pre-0.1 development builds | 0.2.x | Earliest 0.3.0, after recreate has rewritten retained invocations with typed inherited files and the legacy network-FD fixture has been retired; never accept an untyped share. |

## Release checklist

- Review this table and remove expired compatibility entries only when both the
  version window and the row-specific migration gate have passed.
- Never republish an image Catalog revision with different bytes. The embedded
  default and public `catalog.json` must be byte-identical at the same revision;
  same-revision differences are rejected as signed equivocation.

## Commits and pull requests

- One logical change per commit, with a subject in the imperative mood:
  `fix: reconcile SSH config across lifecycle`.
- Explain the reasoning in the body when it is not obvious from the diff.
- Note user-visible changes in `CHANGELOG.md` under `Unreleased`.
