# Changelog

Notable user-visible changes. This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); everything below
1.0.0 is a pre-1.0 developer release and may break between minor versions.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- New inventories and the built-in image catalog default to Ubuntu 24.04
  (`u24:stable`). Explicit image choices and applied deployments are preserved.
- `plan` works before host setup and shows exact image versions, total resources,
  configuration changes, pending starts, and disk replacement effects.
- Default status tables show image and resource information. One degraded node
  no longer hides the rest of the deployment; per-node errors remain visible.
- Starting commands refresh Farrow-managed guest hostnames and control-node SSH
  configuration, including existing peers after expansion or removal. Managed
  guest SSH entries accept recreated lab nodes without manual known_hosts cleanup.

### Fixed

- Selected recreate checks remaining configuration conflicts before deleting
  disks; reload checks startup dependencies before stopping existing guests.
- Destroy and stop read their state under the deployment lock. Runtime cleanup
  preserves listening sockets/live pidfiles, and lifecycle tests use isolated
  runtime directories.
- Invalid integer sizes, fractional CPU counts, and extra YAML documents are
  rejected without truncation or overflow.
- Corrupt deployment state retains its error/path, failed image digest checks
  return integrity errors, and SSH status 255 is passed through consistently.
- ALL_PROXY/all_proxy now supplies a fallback while honoring scheme-specific
  proxies and NO_PROXY. Custom init output paths have usable next commands.
- SSH shorthand help matches its convenience behavior, presentation flags
  respect option values, and --no-wait no longer claims guest readiness.

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- `farrow purge` (alias `farrow rm`) discards the complete applied deployment
  without a confirmation prompt. It deletes every VM, persistent data disks,
  deployment keys and state, and the default SSH client fragment while keeping
  the verified image cache and host-global network. The command is idempotent
  when no deployment exists and still refuses unidentifiable residual node
  artifacts instead of deleting them by path alone.
- The official-image pipeline has an eight-target, digest-pinned candidate
  matrix for Debian 12/13 and Rocky Linux 8/9 on amd64/arm64. Package inputs
  are installed offline from an exact minimal closure, recorded in the SBOM
  and provenance, and can be assembled into a separate unsigned `testing`
  repository without an upstream artifact fallback.

### Changed

- The pinned build and CI toolchain now uses Go 1.27.1, GoReleaser 2.18.0,
  golangci-lint 2.13.2, `golang.org/x/crypto` 0.56.0, and the latest selected
  transitive archive/image modules.
- The default official image repository is now `https://repo.pigsty.io/farrow`.
  Downloading commands accept long-only `--mirror` to select
  `https://repo.pigsty.cc/farrow`; an explicit `--repo` remains highest
  priority, ahead of `--mirror`, `FARROW_REPO`, and the default.
- Catalog upstream URLs are provenance metadata rather than fallback download
  sources when a repository is selected. Catalog SHA-256, artifact size, and
  virtual size identify the final repository qcow2.

### Fixed

- Rocky Linux 8 candidates provide a working `/usr/bin/python3`, remove legacy
  interface naming state, and make the SSH drop-in Include effective. Rocky
  Linux 9 candidates remove the same legacy networking state. Debian 12/13
  candidates include the XFS userspace needed by Farrow data disks.

## [0.4.0]

### Changed

- Pigsty inventory `vm_disks[].fs` now defaults to `auto`: a blank disk is
  formatted XFS when the guest has `mkfs.xfs` and ext4 otherwise, the same
  choice the Pigsty Vagrant flow makes, so the default `/data` disk works on
  Debian and Ubuntu images that ship without xfsprogs. Explicit `xfs` and
  `ext4` never fall back. Deployments created with the old `xfs` default are
  not reported as drift and their persistent disks stay compatible: `auto`
  matches whatever the guest already formatted.
- On a terminal, `farrow up` runs `farrow setup` itself when the fixed-IP
  network has never been installed on the host, then continues. `farrow init`
  points at `farrow up` as the next step.
- One output style across commands: lifecycle commands and `status` print a
  node table (`NAME STATE ADDRESS SSH ARCH PID`) and, after `up`, a
  `next: farrow ssh <node>` hint; `plan` prints one `no changes` line or only
  the rows that change; `validate` prints one line; `image list` prints the
  catalog revision and origin plus an aligned table; `network status`,
  `doctor`, and preflight errors use plain sentences without machine codes;
  `spec hash` and other internals moved to `--json`.
- `farrow ssh <node> -- '<shell line>'` and `farrow exec` pass the remote
  command exactly as OpenSSH does, so `farrow ssh meta -- 'df -h /data; id'`
  works.

### Fixed

- Guest bootstrap failures carry the failing command's last message, so
  readiness reports `guest bootstrap failed during data-disks: xfs requested
  but mkfs.xfs is unavailable` instead of only an exit status.
- Errors about an unknown node name list the nodes the deployment has.

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- `farrow update` fetches the configured image repository's catalog, verifies
  it, and activates it; `image sync` remains the exact-URL/file recovery path.
  Neither operation updates the Farrow executable.
- Pigsty inventory `vm_disks[].fs` accepts explicit `auto`: blank disks prefer
  XFS when its formatter is available and otherwise use ext4. Omitting `fs`
  retains the XFS default.
- Partial multi-node failures name each failed node with its stage and error
  (`2 of 3 node(s) failed: ...`), in text and in the JSON `failures` array,
  and point at `farrow logs <node>` when a guest did not become ready.

### Changed

- Farrow no longer refreshes the image catalog automatically. `up`, `plan`,
  and ordinary `image` commands use the catalog embedded in the installed
  release or the one last activated by explicit `farrow update`/`image sync`,
  so normal resolution never touches the network for catalog metadata.
- Guest network configuration matches interfaces by MAC address and no longer
  renames them to `mgmt0`/`private0`; interface names inside the guest are not
  a Farrow contract.
- `up` and `start` recheck readiness for already-running guests without
  restarting QEMU; `--no-wait` skips the check.
- The management-network egress check retries three times instead of hanging
  on one connection.
- `image reset-manifest` is now `image reset` (the old name remains as an
  alias). Image output and help say "catalog" and "revision" consistently.
- The `ss` command is gone; `up` already installs the SSH client
  configuration, and `ssh-config --install` remains.
- Short flags: commands that read an Inventory use `-f` only for `--file`;
  `logs -f` retains the conventional `--follow`. `--force`, `--rollback`, and
  ssh-config `--remove` have no shorthand, and `--name` no longer takes `-n`.
  Root aliases `cp`, `h`, `i`, and `p` were removed.
- Drift and plan hints suggest `farrow recreate <node>` and
  `farrow destroy <node>` without `--force`; the interactive confirmation
  covers terminals.
- Error messages drop the internal `private` prefix; the missing-inventory
  error points at `farrow init`; `hosts install` without a deployment reports
  the shared `no deployment state found` message with exit 4; an SSH
  configuration failure after a successful lifecycle step exits 5.
- `status` no longer prints a trailing `deployment status` line, and
  `image list` no longer prints digests (use `image info` or `--json`).

### Fixed

- Guest bootstrap failures publish a stage marker, so readiness returns
  `guest bootstrap failed during <stage>` instead of waiting for the full SSH
  timeout, and readiness timeouts report ssh's last error instead of the
  probe's argument list.
- A partially successful lifecycle operation still reconciles the SSH client
  configuration for every committed node.
- Multi-node create no longer reports every guest ready before inspecting the
  per-node readiness outcomes.
- Network preflight failures include the suggested fix in text output, not
  only in JSON.
- `hosts install` now distinguishes a missing deployment (exit 4) from corrupt
  or unsafe deployment state (exit 7) instead of masking every read failure as
  "no deployment state found".

## [0.2.0]

A correctness and hygiene release: every command boundary behaves the same
way under signals, structured output, and misspelled input, and the tree now
carries the gates that keep it that way. The engine, the inventory format, the
state layout, and the embedded image catalog (revision 2026082903) are
unchanged.

### Fixed

- Fixed-IP network preflight now permits less-specific VPN exclusion routes,
  such as a physical-interface `10.0.0.0/8` surrounding Farrow's owned
  `10.10.10.0/24`; equal or more-specific foreign routes, overlapping
  interfaces, and a missing owned route remain hard failures.
- New and recreated guests remove both the released
  `# farrow-project-host` marker and its replacement before writing only
  `# farrow-deployment-host`, so the 0.2 terminology migration converges
  without duplicate `/etc/hosts` rows.
- Selected `up` and incremental scale-out now resolve/download images only for
  nodes being created, preserve committed peer ports and UUIDs, show desired
  nodes without state as `absent`, and generate SSH/host integrations from the
  committed node set instead of failing on uncreated inventory peers.
- Whole start/stop/restart/destroy and persistent-disk validation now tolerate
  desired nodes that have not been created while retaining fail-closed checks
  for every committed node and retained disk.
- `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` now cancel long-running commands through Cobra's context,
  stop progress output, release normal deferred resources, and exit 130 with
  one structured cancellation result; Ctrl-C inside SSH remains remote.
- `farrow reload` is one engine operation: definition drift and removed
  nodes are refused before any node stops, and `--json`/`--yaml` emit a
  single document instead of one per phase.
- `farrow ssh` and `farrow exec` refuse a misspelled node before `--` instead
  of running it as a command on the control node.
- Unknown or repeated node selectors are usage errors (exit 2) reported before
  host preflight or a confirmation prompt, not runtime errors after them.
- `farrow destroy` asks for the same `destroy` token whether or not nodes are
  selected, and prints the exact scope (nodes, disks, keys, state) first.
- Refusing or leaving `farrow setup` confirmation unanswered, and mismatching
  the `destroy`/`recreate` token, now return one cancellation result and exit
  130; only an answered setup prompt defaults to yes. Running `setup` without
  `--yes` on a pipe is a usage error (exit 2), like `destroy` without
  `--force`.
- An interrupted `up`, `recreate`, or `destroy` still appends its event to
  `events.jsonl`, so the audit trail shows what the signal cut short.
- `farrow logs --source events` rejects a node argument instead of silently
  returning the deployment-wide log under that name.
- Combined verbose shorthands (`-vv`, `-nv`) enable diagnostics.
- Structured failure payloads keep the real reason for usage errors that were
  previously written straight to stderr.
- Verbose diagnostics redact credentials and query strings from source URLs.
- `farrow-hosts-helper --help` exits 0; its non-root and positional-argument
  tests no longer pass for the wrong reason.

### Changed

- Marker-owned guest `/etc/hosts` rows now use deployment terminology; the
  0.1.0 marker remains cleanup-only compatibility through the documented
  migration window.
- Inventory validation and migration diagnostics now consistently call the
  single owner-scoped state a deployment rather than a project.
- The post-`up` reminder to run `farrow hosts install --yes` is printed as a
  warning line.
- Ambiguous `farrow ssh`/`farrow exec` invocations without `--` now warn once
  when the first token is treated as a remote command; the existing
  compatibility grammar and exit status remain unchanged.
- Installer and development builds retain at most three verified release
  directories by default; set `FARROW_INSTALL_KEEP=N` to choose another bound
  or `FARROW_INSTALL_KEEP=0` to disable pruning.
- The presentation environment variables `FARROW_OUTPUT` and `FARROW_VERBOSE`
  are read directly; Viper and its nine transitive modules are gone from the
  dependency graph and the shipped license inventory.
- Retired the unreachable user-NAT setup branches and four dead APIs.
- Application releases are built and checksummed by GitHub Actions without a
  separate release-signature or provenance bundle; guest-image Catalog
  Minisign verification remains unchanged.

## [0.1.0]

First public, pre-1.0 developer release of the native Go/QEMU runtime for
Pigsty-compatible local labs.

### Added

- One Pigsty-compatible inventory is both the VM specification and the Pigsty
  deployment inventory; there is no second project format.
- One owner-scoped deployment with fixed-IP additive scale-out on macOS and
  Linux, and explicit drift, recreate, and deletion boundaries.
- QMP plus full process identity, atomic state, transaction journals, and
  manifest-scoped host networking, so lifecycle recovery is fail-closed.
- Signed image catalogs with SHA-256 and qcow2 verification, immutable upstream
  fallback, local imports, and bounded cache pruning.
- Static image repositories: a source-controlled `repo.yaml`, a generated
  schema-3 `catalog.json`, immutable artifact names, and
  `farrow repo scan/build/verify`.
- The signed public repository at `https://repo.pigsty.cc/farrow` is the default
  catalog and artifact mirror; `--repo` and `FARROW_REPO` remain explicit
  overrides, and immutable distribution upstreams remain the fallback.
- Image selection by family, channel, exact release, or numeric version prefix,
  so a Pigsty inventory can keep `vm_image: el9` and pick the newest matching
  9.x build with `vm_version`.
- Interrupted image downloads resume from the staged bytes instead of
  restarting, and are bounded by an inactivity watchdog rather than an overall
  deadline, so a slow link finishes rather than failing partway.
- Release assets: four platform archives, amd64/arm64 DEB and RPM packages,
  dependency licenses, SPDX SBOMs, checksums, a Homebrew formula, a user-scoped
  installer, and keyless Sigstore signature and provenance bundles.

### Fixed

- Inventory parsing now rejects duplicate mapping keys, expands YAML merge keys
  with Ansible-compatible precedence, and refuses alias cycles instead of
  silently resolving a different deployment from the same Pigsty inventory.
- Process birth identity is numeric and independent of locale/timezone; matching
  pre-release development state migrates in place, interrupted QEMU starts are
  adopted only from QMP/UUID/pidfile/invocation proof, and failed starts perform
  bounded compensation.
- Selected `status`, `ssh`, `start`, `stop`, and `restart` operations no longer
  fail because an unrelated peer is degraded; whole-deployment operations retain
  full identity auditing.
- The release installer refuses a missing or invalid Sigstore bundle when
  Cosign is available, and explains that pre-1.0 GitHub pre-releases require an
  explicit `FARROW_VERSION`.
